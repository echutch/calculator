        "Since the first confirmed detection in 1992 by Wolszczan & Frail [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1) of a planet orbiting a distant star, the discovery of thousands of other exoplanets has become one of the greatest achievements of modern astronomy. (The detection of gravitational waves is another!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Thanks to advances in instrumentation and methods of data analysis, over 3,000 exoplanets have been identified to date in more than 2,000 star systems[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2).  The features of these planetary systems—the eccentricity and inclination of planetary orbits, as well as the number of planets in a system—have varied more from system to system than had been expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "The quest for exoplanetary systems is driven in part by curiosity about our own solar system. In the 17th century Sir Isaac Newton realized that the solar system is more organized than is required by the laws of motion[<sup>3</sup>](#fn3).  But for centuries we did not know how similar other planetary systems might be to our own, or even if it was common for other stars to have planets. Is the organization of our solar system unique? Is the Earth unusual in size, and in orbiting the sun in a habitable zone? How were the solar system and the other exoplanet systems formed? With a broad survey of exoplanets we can begin addressing some of these questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solar system comprises eight planets (nine if you cannot live without Pluto!), moving in nearly circular orbits around the sun with an average eccentricity of 0.06. Their orbital planes are nearly parallel to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun’s rotation axis. Most of the solar system’s angular momentum resides in the planets, with the sun’s rotational angular momentum contributing only about ~0.5% of the total. Inspired by these facts, the French scholar Pierre- Simon Laplace (1749 – 1827) devoted much of his life to constructing a theory of the motions of the planets, arguing that the stability of the solar system would not require “periodic divine intervention.” [<sup>4</sup>](#fn4)\n",

        "In 1995 Mayor & Queloz[<sup>5</sup>](#fn5) discovered the first exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star (a star with mass close to $M_\\odot$, the solar mass). It is 51 Pegasi, 15.6 parsecs (50.9 light years) from us in the constellation Pegasus. Its planetary companion is 51 Pegasi b, now called “Dimidium,” a gas giant that is about half as massive as Jupiter. It was detected indirectly, through observation of a periodic variation in the Doppler shift of light from 51 Pegasi as the star and its planet orbited the two-body center of mass. This is one of the most effective techniques in the hunt for new planets.\n",

        "Here are some of the techniques used in searches for exoplanets.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Doppler spectroscopy (gives planet mass). Searchers use the Doppler effect to measure the star's velocity variation as the star and planet orbit their center of mass. The period of the spectral variation yields the planet’s mass from Kepler's 3rd law. Depending on the mass of the star, Earth-sized exoplanets can be detected out to 50 to 1,000 parsecs (1 parsec = $1.0857 \\times 10^{16}$ m, about 3.26 lightyears), while Jupiter-sized planets can be found out to 1,000 parsecs.[<sup>7</sup>](#fn7) [<sup>8</sup>](#fn8)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Transient photometry (gives planet radius). When a planet crosses in front of its host star it will block a small amount of light that would otherwise reach the earth, causing a sometimes-detectable reduction in the star’s apparent brightness. The fractional change in brightness should be proportional to the ratio of the cross sectional areas of the planet and star. If we are able to estimate the size of the star, we can determine the planet’s radius.[<sup>9</sup>](#fn9)  A disadvantage of this technique is that it requires the earth-bound observer to reside close to the plane that contains the exoplanet’s orbit. This is not the case for most exoplanet systems! For example, the probability that a randomly placed distant observer could detect the earth’s transit across the disk of the sun would be somewhat less than a half percent.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Pulsar timing variations (give planet mass). A pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star or white dwarf whose strong magnetic fields ($\\sim 10^{10}$ T) are not aligned with the object’s rotation axis. The rapid rotation of the star induces (changing) electric fields that generate a high-energy beam of protons and electrons. Astronomers can detect the radiofrequency signatures of the beam as it sweeps across earth’s line-of-sight to the pulsar. Because pulsar rotation rates are very regular—some are more precise than atomic clocks—the detected frequency on earth is very sensitive to anomalies, such as a Doppler shift caused by the influence of a companion planet.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Direct imaging. Direct imaging of an exoplanet is difficult, but not impossible. In most cases the host star will outshine the intrinsic thermal radiation from the planet, but when the planet is big enough, far enough from its parent star, or hot enough to emit stronger radiation, it can actually be seen in images. For direct imaging, astronomers use “coronagraphs,” designed to block most light from the host star imaged by a camera, leaving the planet visible. An example is the HR 8799 system in the constellation Pegasus. Three of its planets, each with a mass several times grater than Jupiter’s, were first seen in 2008. A fourth was observed in 2009.[<sup>10</sup>](#fn10) It is also possible that “orphan” planets, which are not bound to a stars, might be detected by direct imaging.\n",

        "\n",
        "When we look at a star, where are the “received” photons actually coming from? Think of a star as a sphere of plasma, comprising a huge number of moving ions and free electrons. In the interior of the star where the photons are produced, the density of charged particles is so high (about $10^{26}$ particles per $cm^3$ in the sun[<sup>12</sup>](#fn12)\n",
        ") and the environment so hot that propagating photons scatter frequently, typically within a centimeter. The photons that escape from a star without further scattering tend to come from a thin shell called the photosphere at the star’s surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The observed features in stellar spectra—the profile of brightness as a function of wavelength, along with emission and absorption lines, arise from the physical processes taking place in the star’s photosphere (and deeper regions), as well as the atmospheres of the star and the earth. Much of the received light is blackbody radiation, the stellar equivalent of the glow from the hot coils of a toaster. But elements near the surface of the sun also emit and absorb light at frequencies corresponding to quantum transitions between energy levels, yielding bright and dark spectral lines. Absorption in the star’s atmosphere, as well as the earth’s (for ground-based observations), further shapes spectral observations. The following figure shows the hydrogen emission spectrum; the figure after that shows the solar spectrum arriving at the surface of the earth.[<sup>13</sup>](#fn13)"

The system is seen nearly edge-on, and from the derived planetary orbital parameters, six have nearly circular orbits with eccentricity < 0.1. Further, the orbits are almost co-planar. In the near future Spitzer, Hubble, Kepler, and the future James Webb Space Telescope will perform follow-up observations, hoping to determine their atmospheric composition (and therefore habitability).
